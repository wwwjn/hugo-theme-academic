I am a first-year Master of Science student at CS department of Stanford University. I got my bachelor degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing (2016-2020). Before I become a student in Stanford, I worked as a software and network engineer (FTE) in ByteDance, System and Networking team (2020-2021). My interest lays in building reliable large-scale systems for computing, Machine Learning and other kinds of tasks.

In my life, I love photography and travel.
